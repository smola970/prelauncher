    <strong>PRIVACY POLICY</strong>
</p>
<p>
    . (<strong><em>PULL YOUR LOOK</em></strong>) considers the privacy and security of user information an important component of the services offered at its
    website, www.pullyourlook.com.au (the <strong><em>Site</em></strong>). The following information explains how Pull Your Look collects and uses information obtained from
    users in connection with services available at the Site (taken together, the <strong><em>Service</em></strong>).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Information Collected.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    At your election, you may request additional information about Pull Your Look. When you do so, you may need to submit certain information or data to Pull Your Look, for
    example, your contact information (collectively, <strong><em>User Data</em></strong>).
</p>
<p>
    When you visit the Site, web servers collect "traffic data" (such as, for example, time and date, the address of the website from which you entered the
    Site) about your visit, which is stored as anonymous, aggregate data. Collecting such data may entail the use of IP addresses or other numeric codes used
    to identify a computer.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Use of Information.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Pull Your Look uses User Data to respond to your inquiries for additional information.
</p>
<p>
    Pull Your Look uses "traffic data" to help diagnose problems with its server, analyze trends and administer the Site. Your IP address is not linked to personally
    identifiable information, but is used to gather broad demographic data and to monitor statistics to improve the Site and Service.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Sharing of Information.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Currently, Pull Your Look will not share personally identifiable information with any third party for commercial purposes. Pull Your Look may, however, disclose
    personally identifiable data if (1) reasonably necessary to perform the Service, (2) authorized by you, (3) otherwise permitted under this Privacy Policy
    or (4) Pull Your Look is required to do so by law or regulation, or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) conform or comply with
    applicable laws, regulations or legal process, (ii) protect or defend the rights or property of Pull Your Look or any other user or (iii) enforce the Terms of
    Use.
</p>
<p>
    Pull Your Look may transfer personally identifiable information to any successor to all or substantially all of its business or assets that concern the Service.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Security.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Information collected by Pull Your Look is stored in secure operating environments that are not made generally available to the public. Unfortunately, no data
    transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, Pull Your Look cannot ensure the security of any information you provide, and you
    do so at your own risk. Once Pull Your Look receives your transmission, it will make reasonable efforts to ensure its security on its systems.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Third Party Sites.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The Site may permit you to link to other websites on the Internet, and other websites may contain links to the Site. These other websites are not under
    Pull Your Look control. The privacy and security practices of websites linked to or from the Site are not covered by this Privacy Policy, and Pull Your Look is not
    responsible for the privacy or security practices or the content of such websites.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>IP Addresses and Cookies.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Pull Your Look may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with its server, and to administer the Site. Your IP address is used to help identify you and to
    gather broad demographic information. IP addresses are also used to provide an audit trail in the case of any attempted illegal or unauthorized use of the
    Site.
</p>
<p>
    "Cookies" are pieces of information that a website transfers to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. Cookies in and of themselves do not
    personally identify users, although they do identify a user's computer. You may be able to set your web browser to refuse cookies.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Changes.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Pull Your Look reserves the right to change or update this Privacy Policy at any time by posting a notice at the Site. Information collected by the Service is
